# 🎧 Small Demo Manager 

This is a new version of the "[CS2-SourceTV-Demo-Voice-Calculator](https://github.com/pythaeusone/CS2-SourceTV-Demo-Voice-Calculator)"

[![Get it from Microsoft](https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20dark.svg)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nkbsbk8rtwp?cid=DevShareMCLPCB)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It often happens that Valve changes the demo structure with a CS2 update.
> 
> The parser then needs to be updated, and updates take over three days to be released in the MS Store.
